A Home Assistant custom integration that replaces the webhook-based Ecowitt integration with local web interface polling to solve sensor ID stability issues and provide enhanced device organization.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The existing Home Assistant Ecowitt integration relies on webhooks with fundamental limitations:
- **Unstable Entity IDs**: Channel-based naming that changes when batteries die
- **HTTP Exposure Required**: Must expose Home Assistant over HTTP for gateway webhook delivery
- **Limited Data**: Missing battery levels, signal strength, and hardware IDs
- **Poor Organization**: All sensors lumped under gateway device
- **Protocol Constraints**: Cannot be fixed within webhook paradigm

## ✅ Our Solution

**🏷️ Hardware-Based Stable Entity IDs**: Use sensor hardware IDs for permanent entity identification
- `sensor.soil_moisture_1` → `sensor.ecowitt_soil_moisture_d8174`
- Entity IDs never change when batteries are replaced
- Perfect historical data continuity
- Automations that never break

**📱 Individual Sensor Devices**: Each physical sensor gets its own Home Assistant device
- Soil moisture sensors as dedicated devices with moisture + battery + online status
- Weather sensors organized by function (temperature/humidity, wind, rain, etc.)
- Clean device tree matching your physical sensor setup

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔒 Enhanced Security & Reliability
- **No HTTP exposure required** - Unlike webhook integration that requires HA accessible over HTTP
- **Direct polling** - More reliable than webhook dependency  
- **Robust error handling** - Continues working during network hiccups

### 📊 Rich Data & Monitoring
- **Battery levels** - Monitor all sensor batteries
- **Signal strength** - Track RF connection quality
- **Online status** - Know when sensors go offline
- **Inactive sensors** - Option to include offline devices
- **Hardware information** - Channel, device model, firmware version

### 🏠 Superior Device Organization  
- **Individual sensor devices** - Each physical sensor becomes a HA device
- **Diagnostic categorization** - Monitoring info in diagnostic section
- **Clean main view** - Focus on sensor data, not system health
- **Automatic device assignment** - Entities go to correct sensor devices

### 🔧 Developer & Maintainer Friendly
- **89% test coverage** - Comprehensive automated testing
- **Type safety** - Full mypy type checking
- **Code optimization** - Dynamic sensor generation reduces duplication
- **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and quality checks

## 📋 Requirements

- Home Assistant Core 2024.1.0+
- Ecowitt Gateway (GW1000, GW1100A, GW2000, etc.) with firmware 2.0.0+
- Local network access to gateway web interface

## 🔧 Services

The integration provides services for manual control:

### `ecowitt_local.refresh_mapping`
Force refresh of sensor hardware ID mapping
- **Use case**: After adding new sensors or changing gateway configuration
- **Target**: Specific device or all devices

### `ecowitt_local.update_data`  
Force immediate update of live sensor data
- **Use case**: Get fresh readings before automations run
- **Target**: Specific device or all devices

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes from Original Integration

This integration uses **hardware-based entity IDs** instead of **channel-based IDs**:

**Old naming (unstable)**:
- `sensor.soil_moisture_1` ← Changes when batteries die
- `sensor.soil_moisture_2` ← Assignment depends on reconnection order

**New naming (permanent)**:  
- `sensor.ecowitt_soil_moisture_d8174` ← Never changes
- `sensor.ecowitt_soil_moisture_d8648` ← Hardware ID based

### Migration & Device Organization

**From webhook integration**: Entities will be recreated with new IDs and organized into individual sensor devices

**From earlier versions**: Automatic migration reassigns entities to proper devices

You will need to update:
- 🏠 **Automations** - Update entity IDs in triggers and conditions
- 📊 **Dashboards** - Update cards with new entity IDs  
- 📜 **Scripts** - Update any hardcoded entity references
- 🔔 **Notifications** - Update entity IDs in notification templates

The integration provides detailed logging to help identify which entities need updating.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify gateway IP address is correct
- Ensure Home Assistant can reach the gateway on your network
- Check if gateway web interface is accessible via browser
- Confirm gateway firmware is 2.0.0+

### Authentication Issues  
- Verify password if gateway requires authentication
- Try accessing gateway web interface manually
- Some gateways may not require a password

### Missing Sensors
- Use "Refresh Sensor Mapping" service to update hardware mappings
- Check if sensors are properly paired with gateway
- Enable "Include Inactive Sensors" option to see offline devices
- Check diagnostic logs for sensor discovery issues

### Device Assignment Issues
- Entities should appear under individual sensor devices after installation
- For existing installations, restart Home Assistant to trigger migration
- Check logs for migration messages and any assignment failures
- Use the refresh mapping service if devices aren't organized correctly

### Performance Issues
- Increase polling intervals if gateway becomes unresponsive
- Default settings work well for most setups
- Monitor Home Assistant logs for API errors
- Consider reducing number of inactive sensors if performance is poor
