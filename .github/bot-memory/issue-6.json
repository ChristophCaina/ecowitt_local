The WH90 device is being detected (hardware ID B845) but no entities are being created\n2. The live data JSON shows valid sensor readings using hex IDs (0x02, 0x07, etc.)\n3. The GW3000 gateway is partially working but s..."

      "analysis": "Based on the conversation history, I can see this is a follow-up discussion about the WH90 implementation where some progress has been made but there are still some issues to resolve.\n\n## Current Status Analysis\n1. WH90 now creates 6 entities (improvement from zero, but incomplete)\n2. GW3000 showing sensor IDs \"3\" and \"5\" that should be mapped to:\n   - \"3\" \u2192 \"Feels Like\" temperature\n   - \"5\" \u2192 \"VPD\" (Vapor Pressure Deficit)\n\n## Additional Mapping Needed\nLooking at the code in `sensor_mapper.py`,..."
