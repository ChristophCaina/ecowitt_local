- ‚úÖ Issues are reopened
- ‚úÖ Someone comments `@bot` in an issue

### Manual Triggers
You can also trigger analysis by commenting:
- `@bot analyze` - Full issue analysis
- `@bot help` - Show available commands
- `@bot status` - Show issue memory/history

## What the Bot Does

### 1. **Initial Analysis**
```markdown
ü§ñ **Ecowitt Local Bot Analysis**

## Issue Classification

- Device-specific labels (`GW3000`, `WH69`, etc.)

## Memory System

The bot stores memory in `.github/bot-memory/issue-{number}.json`:

```json
{
  "issue_number": 123,
  "analysis_count": 2,
  "status": "analyzing", 
  "user_provided_data": [
    {
      "type": "json_dump",
      "content": "...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15T11:00:00"
    }
  ],
  "similar_issues": [...],
  "estimated_complexity": "moderate"
}
```

## Budget & Limits

### Current Settings
- **Monthly Budget**: $10.00
- **Max Tokens per Issue**: 50,000

The bot can be controlled via issue comments:

- `@bot pause` - Pause bot for this issue
- `@bot resume` - Resume bot analysis
- `@bot reset` - Clear issue memory
- `@bot debug` - Show detailed analysis info

## Privacy & Security

### What the Bot Stores
- ‚úÖ Issue content and metadata
- ‚úÖ Analysis history and responses
- ‚úÖ User-provided diagnostic data
- ‚úÖ Similar issue references

### What It Doesn't Store
- ‚ùå Personal information
- ‚ùå API keys or credentials
- ‚ùå Private repository data
- ‚ùå User behavioral data

### Data Retention
- Issue memory: 90 days after issue closure
- Analysis logs: 30 days
- Budget tracking: Current month only

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
1. Check if budget limit was exceeded
2. Verify `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Look for errors in GitHub Actions logs
4. Ensure issue has required labels/triggers

### Unexpected Responses
1. Check `.github/bot-memory/issue-{number}.json` for context
2. Review recent analysis history
3. Use `@bot reset` to clear memory if needed

### Cost Concerns
1. Monitor spending in GitHub Actions logs
2. Adjust `CLAUDE_MONTHLY_BUDGET` if needed
3. Review token usage patterns
4. Use manual triggers instead of automatic

## Contributing
